# Mask R-CNN for Object Detection and Segmentation

This is a fork of the [Mask R-CNN](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN) implementation by matterport. This fork contains only the main model definition and configuration files.

This is intended to be used as a simple library style package, leaving out the examples and demos from the original repository.
